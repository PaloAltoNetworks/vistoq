Vistoq Demo Experience
======================

The demo portal is designed to show the 'art of the possible' specific to firewall configuration
and instantiation.

Easy Button Demo
----------------

Simple internet gateway demo hiding most of the configuration fields. Emphasis on simplicity
for a higher level audience. Configure Panorama and instantiate the firewall.

Internet Gateway Demo
---------------------

Same as the easy button but with the option of seeing template values. Also includes a stand-alone
firewall option and SET command output for copy/paste CLI configuration.

GPCS Demo
---------

Internet gateway demo for remote branches. Three components:

1. Configure the baseline configuration in Panorama

2. Add an IPSEC-based remote network connection

3. Output the IPSEC config for the CPE device

Deploy
------

Option to bootstrap a device without the Panorama config workflow included.
